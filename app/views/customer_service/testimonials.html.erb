      <p>I have been using Muro for more than 15 years, and just so you know there are many reasons why we have been together for so long. Trust, dependability and service are important to me. <br><br>I drive around 1 million screws per year so I need reliable equipment to meet the rigors of my day to day work. The team at Muro delivers what I need to make it easier for me to get all my jobs completed.</p>

      <p>Some decisions really are “no brainers.”  Switching to Muro’s stand-up screw gun was one of them.  Instead of kneeling on the floorboard and using elbow-grease every eight inches, the employees now stand upright and allow the weight of the screw-gun to do most of the labor.  This has resulted in increased throughput and a probable reduction in workmen comp claims - zero since we began using Muro 5 years ago.  Definitely worth testing.</p>

      <p>Out of the many we have tried here at Forest River, yours is the best product to have been purchased. We have a total of five running a day at all times, screwing our floors down in our large buses onto the steel frames. The product withstands the pressure and abuse of the hardworking linemen. We appreciate your product and will continue using for a very long time!</p>

      <p>We have and continue to recommend the Muro Screw system for use with our Iron Woods brand decking. We have found that the Ejector screws do an outstanding job of fastening Ipe without predrilling in both commercial and residential applications. We would not hesitate to recommend this system to any contractor looking for a reliable self-drilling collated screw system for hardwoods decking.</p>
