    <div class="answer" id="answer1">
      <span class="A">A.</span><p>Muro bits are a higher quality than the standard bits you normally purchase, and all our bits are double ended – two tips (except for hex drive bits). That being said, life expectancy will vary depending on application and experience of the user. The key to long bit life is to make sure you keep constant pressure on the tool while the screw is being driven, do not to let the bit slip out of the screw
  recess; if the bit happens to stick in the recess, it is extremely important to pull straight up – do not
  wiggle the tool side to side.

  <br><br>In most cases a bit should last several boxes of screws – 1 pack (10 bits)  for every 80-100 boxes is a
  good gauge – make sure to always have a couple of extra, just in case.</p>

    <div class="answer" id="answer2">
      <span class="A">A.</span><p>The problem of inconsistent countersinking associated with driving screws by hand has been eliminated - all Muro Systems have a positive (hard) stop which helps to ensure constant screw depth each and every time – no more guess work, set it and forget it.

    <br><br>Please refer to your instruction manual or the videos/pictures on the web site to learn more on how to setup your tool for optimum performance.</p>

      of compressed air to blow out the tool body and feeding mechanism.  Also, make sure that all air holes
      are un-obstructed.<br><br>

      Occasionally wipe down the guide poles – no lubrication is required, they are packed with grease and are self-lubricating.<br><br>

    <div class="answer" id="answer15">
      <span class="A">A.</span><p>This, in most cases, is a very simple problem to fix and it can happen out of the blue - everything is working fine then all of a sudden it doesn’t work as it normally does:
      <br><br>
      1/ Check to make sure the motor is in forward; sometimes the reverse lever/button gets switched by accident. Fix – put tool back in forward.
      <br><br>
      2/Check the condition of the bit; a worn bit can just spin in the recess. Fix – flip or change the bit.
      <br><br>
      3/ Check condition of the bit holder; over time it can wear. Fix – order a new bit holder.
      <br><br>
      4/ Keep constant pressure on the tool/screw (push down on handle bar) until the screw has been completely driven and you hear the clutch engage.
      <br><br>
     5/ A more serious problem is the clutch is worn out and it is just slipping. Fix - need to send the motor in for service.
